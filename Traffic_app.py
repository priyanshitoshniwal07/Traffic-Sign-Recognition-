            16:'Vehicle > 3.5 tons prohibited The "Vehicle > 3.5 tons prohibited" sign indicates that vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tons are not allowed to enter the specified area or use the indicated road. This restriction helps in managing traffic, preventing heavy vehicles from accessing roads not suitable for their weight, and ensuring road safety.',
            17:'No entry The "No Entry" sign prohibits vehicles from entering the designated area or roadway. It indicates that the specified route is off-limits, usually for reasons such as safety, traffic management, or restricted access. Drivers must obey this sign to prevent unauthorized entry and maintain order on the road.',
            18:'General caution',
            19:'Dangerous curve left',
            20:'Dangerous curve right',
            21:'Double curve',
            22:'Bumpy road The "Bumpy Road" sign warns drivers of an uneven or rough road surface ahead. It alerts motorists to reduce speed and exercise caution to safely navigate through the area, minimizing the risk of accidents or damage to vehicles.',
            23:'Slippery road',
            24:'Road narrows on the right The "Road Narrows on the Right" sign indicates that the width of the road will decrease on the right side ahead. Drivers should be prepared for a narrower roadway and potentially adjust their position accordingly to ensure safe passage, especially when encountering oncoming traffic or obstacles.',
            25:'Road work The "Road Work" sign alerts drivers to ongoing construction or maintenance activities on the road ahead. It warns motorists to be prepared for potential changes in road conditions, such as lane closures, reduced speed limits, or temporary detours. Drivers should exercise caution, follow any posted instructions, and be mindful of construction workers and equipment in the area.',
            26:'Traffic signals The term "Traffic Signals" refers to the system of lights (red, yellow, green) and sometimes arrows, installed at intersections or roadways to regulate the flow of traffic. These signals dictate when vehicles should stop, yield, or proceed, helping to manage traffic efficiently and prevent accidents. Drivers must obey traffic signals to ensure safe and orderly movement on the road.',
            27:'Pedestrians The term "Pedestrians" refers to individuals who are traveling on foot, such as walking or running, along sidewalks, crosswalks, or other designated pedestrian areas. Pedestrians have the right of way at crosswalks and intersections, and drivers are required to yield to them to ensure their safety. Pedestrian crossings and signs are used to indicate where pedestrians can safely cross roads and where drivers should be particularly cautious.',
            28:'Children crossing The "Children Crossing" sign alerts drivers to the presence of a designated area where children are likely to cross the road, such as near schools, parks, or residential areas.
